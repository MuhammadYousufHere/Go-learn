# GO Language

<!-- WHY SHOULD YOU LEARN GO -->

1 - RUNS FAST
2 - Garbage Collection (automatic) - memory managment - when memory is allocated - when should memory should be deallocated
3 - Simple Objects - structs

### no inheritance

### no constructors

### no generics

all makes runs faster
4 - Concurrency is efficient
managings multiple tasks at the same time
key requirenments for large systems
concurrent programmings enables parallelism
mangamanet of task execution
communication b/w task
synchronize b/w task

Goroutines - concurrent task
Channels - communication b/w task
Select - enable sync b/w task
5 - compile language with some features of interpreted language (i.e. garbage collection)

## Machine laguages - low level language

directly executed on the CPU
CPU instructions represents the binary

## Assembly Languages

CPU intructions with mnemonics (english)
easier to read (one to one mapping with machine lang)

## High level language - big categories -C, C++, Python, Java, GO etc

Easier to use
languages with variable(other do not have variables)

Compilation VS Interperetion

compile:
before ruunning the program
translation occurrs once.
faster generally

interpret:
while code is execute
on the fly
slows you down

First thought - Similiar to JavaScript
First you would declease entry point as 'package main' at the top of your file.

# Object Orientation

Organise your code through encapsulation
group together data and functions that are related

## Declearing a types

type Age int

## Declearing a variable

## If-Else in GO
